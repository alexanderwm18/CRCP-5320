Final Project for Aesthetics and Computation

Painting Music 
Alexander Williams, Kish Parikh, and Claire Brandenberger
The Painting Music project created by Kish, Claire, and Alexander is intended to be an interactive music visualizer, 
as we are seeing more and more of these days on YouTube or other forms of music streaming platforms. What makes our 
project unique, is that it allows the user interaction to generate a unique image almost every time the program is run. 
Often, I feel as though visualizers either let you explore the world you are in by rotating a 3-D camera, or simply 
force you to watch as a computer-generated entity makes its way around the screen. Our program allows you to paint on 
a computer-generated canvas with an audio reactive brush. The combination of generative art and user interaction leads 
to very interesting results and provides a new avenue for appreciating a personâ€™s favorite songs. Primarily we employed 
external data usage, in the form of song choice, and spatialization as I believe understanding the color patterns and canvas 
size allows you to get creative in what type of image you want to generate. I think our project inspires one to consider the 
possibilities of combining generative aspects with non-generative aspects in the same project. As it takes both machine and man 
to generate the most interesting results this program can offer.
